# Nuclear Reactor Simulator

Educational full-plant nuclear reactor simulator built with **C# / .NET 10 / Avalonia**. The project models a reduced RBMK-like plant as a deterministic, headless-testable simulation with an operator-facing desktop control room.

It targets internally consistent educational behaviour, conservation, replayability and explicit model limits rather than industrial licensing-grade fidelity.

## Current work

M10.9.4.1 / Phase I and M10.9.5 **Contextual Command Consequence Model** are validated and closed. Authoritative desktop production remains exact `integrated-operations-desktop-stable@4` with `CorrelationConsistentInverseDomain` thermodynamics and `FourNodeBranchContinuityCorrectedCommitOptIn` hydraulics at the unchanged 10 ms fixed step.

M10.9.6.1 **Challenge Lifecycle & Logical-Time Contract** is validated.

Current candidate: **M10.9.6.2 Hotfix 1 — Nullable Demand-Output Error Compile Fix**. The M10.9.6.2 demand semantics are unchanged; Hotfix 1 fixes only explicit nullable typing for observational demand/output error evidence after the first build exposed CS0173. It adds versioned challenge-owned logical-step demand references (constant, step, bounded ramp and piecewise HOLD/LINEAR) while keeping `EXTERNAL GRID DEMAND`, generator requested load and actual electrical output strictly separate. Demand never commands the generator or grid model, and no scoring arithmetic or challenge UI is introduced.

The authoritative checkpoint and validation sequence live in:

**[`docs/PROJECT.md`](docs/PROJECT.md)**

## Build and test

```bat
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

For the active M10.9.6.2 Hotfix 1 candidate:

```bat
dotnet build
dotnet test
scripts\run-m1096-external-energy-demand-audit.cmd
```

## Core runtime principles

- deterministic external fixed timestep;
- simulation logic independent from UI refresh/wall-clock cadence;
- explicit mass/energy ownership;
- fail-closed numerical correction/rollback contracts;
- exact-version scenario/save/replay identities are never silently reinterpreted;
- GUI contains no reactor-physics calculations;
- headless automated validation remains authoritative.

## Documentation

Start at **[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)**.

The current documentation is intentionally split by responsibility rather than milestone chronology:

- `docs/PROJECT.md` — **only** current status/handoff/active validation source;
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — future milestones and sequencing;
- `docs/KNOWN_MODEL_LIMITATIONS.md` — unresolved model limitations;
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — stable architecture and ownership;
- subsystem documents — detailed technical reference;
- `docs/history/` — superseded milestone/hotfix chronology;
- `docs/adr/` — architectural decisions.

Generated audit CSV/TXT payloads and `tests/.../Gameplay/Evidence` are deliberately excluded from candidate ZIPs. Compact frozen prerequisites required by ordinary tests live under `eng/frozen-evidence/`.

## Safety and scope

This is an educational simulator, not a reactor design, operations, licensing or safety-analysis tool. Thermodynamic properties, component models, spatial physics, protection and severe-incident behaviour are reduced-order approximations with documented limitations.
